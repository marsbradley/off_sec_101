# Offensive Security 101 

## What is this?
This is a lesson plan for a course covering variety of methods and tools of interest to the budding hacker. This course assumes no prior knowledge of security concepts (other than the very basic) and techniques, but is aimed at those with a technical computer science background.

## How does this work?
The lesson plan is divided up into 8 topics/chunks, with a initial session dedicated to preparing the necessary environment for later lessons (intended to be performed before the students attend lesson 1). The students will need to use VMs throughout the course so having a machine that is capable of running VM Player with a VM or two at the same time is necessary.
