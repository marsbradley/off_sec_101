The exercises are meant to give you some basic practice with XSS.

## Web Exercises

We will use https://xss-game.appspot.com, which is an XSS-driven game developed by Google.

There are 6 exercises, with increasing difficulty.

Make sure to use the `Toggle Code` function to get a glimpse of the source code.


## OWASP Mutillidae II

OWASP Mutillidae II is a free, open source, deliberately vulnerable web-application providing a target for web-security enthusiast.

## Setup

Run the command `docker run -d -p 80:80 citizenstig/nowasp`.

NOTE: This image may take a while to download.

Once complete, go to localhost:80 in your browser.

If you see a database connection error, click `Setup/Reset the DB` link at the top of the page, and click OK on the resulting dialog box.

## Exercises

Navigate to the OWASP 2013 section, then A3 - Cross Site Scripting.

Here, we will focus on Reflected (First Order) and Persistent (Second Order).

Try some of the exploit examples you've seen earlier, each example shows a potential attack vector.

This section also includes some much more advanced scenarios, which you can try to complete.


## Teardown

Type `docker ps` to get the list of running docker containers.

Get the container ID of the running OWASP container, and type `docker kill <ID>` to stop the container running.
