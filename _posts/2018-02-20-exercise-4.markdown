title:  "Exercise 4 | Web Injection"
---

The exercises are meant to give you some basic practice with SQL injection.

### Setup Exercises

The exercises are a series of PHP web applications connected to a MySQL databases to simulate common real world scenarios where SQL injection may be possible.

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose
The files are stored in docker images to be deployed with docker-compose. This makes it easier to start up locally, teardown and redeploy if need be.

To install docker in Kali Linux, follow the instructions [here][DOCKER_INSTRUCTIONS]:

If you get this error during apt-get update:

```
The following signatures were invalid: EXPKEYSIG ED444FF07D8D0BF6 Kali Linux Repository <devel@kali.org>
```

It means one of the certificates for the kali repositories expired, try updating it with the following command:

```wget -q -O - https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | apt-key add```

Afterwards, to install docker-compose in Kali Linux, run the following:

```apt-get install docker-compose```


#### Load Exercises
Download the docker images tar [here][EXERCISE_TAR]

Extract with:

```tar -xzvf sqli-exercises.tar.gz```

Go into the directory and run:

```docker-compose up --build```

This may take some time to complete as it downloads the base docker images for the first time.

At the end, if all goes according to plan you should see the exercises by opening your browser and going to localhost.

### Exercise 1:

You should see the 'Offensive Security Cheese Store'. Try to search through the cheeses available using the search box.
For example try searching 'camembert', you should get back some results for Camembert cheese.

Try to get the password of the 'admin' user with sql injection.

### Exercise 2:

This is a slightly improved version of the cheese store.

The developer has escaped inputs using '[real-escape-string][MYSQL_ESCAPE_STRING_DOCS]'.

Try to get the password of the 'admin' user with this version.

**Note:** The table names are the same as in Exercise 1.

**Hint:**
Is there another input used in the url?

### Exercise 3:

The input in exercise 2 has been removed now.

Try to get the password of the 'admin' user with this version.

**Note:** The table names are the same as in Exercise 1.

**Hint:**
PHP can use POST requests to send data between the client and the server.
You can see network requests using the Firefox browser installed on Kali.

### Additional Practice:
