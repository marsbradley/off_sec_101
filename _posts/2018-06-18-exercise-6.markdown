title:  "Exercise 6 | Memory Exploitation"
---

Today's exercises will be a bit different from the usual. Due to the nature of memory exploitation being a little bit more involved than the previous topics we've worked on (both in terms of necessary understanding and the mechanics of actually performing an attack) more of this lesson's exercise will focus on **self guided learning**. This doesn't mean that we won't be offering help around the class, but that a larger portion of your time will likely be taken up doing what you're currently doing right now; **reading**. This is due to the fact that an hour long class is barely enough to scratch the surface when it comes to Memory Exploitation, which requires a bit more domain specific knowledge than previously seen attacks.

As mentioned in the lecture, but worth a reminder; don't feel discouraged! Feel free to work together with others, as pooling knowledge can lead to breakthoughs in understanding. This is genuinely difficult material though, that only a small number of practitioners around the world would call themselves "experts" in (compared to say the thousands of "script kiddies" practicing web attacks). Even making a small amount of headway into the first exercise is an achievement in itself.

But hey, that makes it all the more rewarding when you finally crack it!!

So let's jump in...

### Exercise 1:

[dostackoverflowbuffergood][DOGOOD]; This is a really great intro tutorial, that walks you through step by step, even getting set up with a debugger. You could also use gdb as this is standard Linux one, but the instructions won't be as helpful then. Note that you'll need to use [Wine][WINE] to run the programs mentioned in this tutorial, but I'm 99% it's installed on Kali Linux already. You could also use a Windows VM, as suggested in the tutorial, but this does take additional setup time!

### Exercise 2:

[Corelan Exercise][CORELAN]; This is another walkthrough/look at doing stack based overflows, with a very interesting "real world" scenario. Again you'll need to have [Wine][WINE] installed (why do all these exploits seem to be on Windows??)

### Exercise 3:

You've made it this far? Look at you, you leet hax0r... 

Why not try your hand at [Fuzzy Security's ROP Tutorial][FUZZY]. This is certainly a bit more advanced than the last too, but I'm sure you can handle it?!
